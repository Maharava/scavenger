  - **Potential Loot:** `Repair Paste`, `Salvaged Components`, `Basic Electronics` (from exposed wiring), `Polymer Resin`, `Water` (from leaking pipes).

- **Workshop / Fabricator Bay:**
  - **Description:** A room with machine tools, workbenches, and half-finished projects. Spare parts and raw materials are often stored here.
  - **Potential Loot:** `Repair Paste`, `Titanium Alloy`, `Polymer Resin`, `Ceramic-Composite Plate`, `Salvaged Components`, `Basic Electronics`.

- **Cargo Bay / Loading Dock:**
  - **Description:** A vast, open space with massive external doors and scattered cargo containers of various sizes. A prime target for any scavenger.
  - **Potential Loot:** High chance for a wide variety of all common/uncommon materials. Especially `Aramid Fibres`, `Polymer Resin`, `Salvaged Components`, `Titanium Alloy`, and `Preserved Food`.
