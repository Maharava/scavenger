# Ship Interactable Ideas

## Storage & Item Management
- **Crate / Cargo Container:** A container with a local inventory.
- **Ship Crate / Ship Cargo:** An access point to the shared, ship-wide cargo hold.
- **Drop Chute:** A one-way chute to send items directly to the ship's cargo hold during an expedition.
- **Resource Recycler:** Breaks down unwanted equipment and modules into their base components.

## Survival & Recovery
- **Hydroponics Bay:** Consumes water and `Organic Protein` to grow food over time.
- **Stove:** Allows for the crafting of meals from raw food items, providing better stat restoration.
- **Shower:** Increases the player's `Comfort` and reduces `Stress`.
- **Bed:** Restores the `Rest` stat. Higher quality beds can also improve `Comfort`.
- **Auto-Doc:** Applies a heal-over-time effect. Consumes `Organic Protein` and `Chemical Compounds` to enhance the healing rate significantly.

## Ship Systems & Progression
- **Weapons Workbench:** Modify weapons. Pulls from player and ship inventory for modules.
- **Armour Workbench:** Modify armour. Pulls from player and ship inventory for modules.
- **Bridge:** The ship's command center. Used to travel to expedition locations.
- **Scanner:** Discovers new expedition locations. Can be upgraded to find rarer and more dangerous sites.
- **Refinery:** Converts biomass and organic materials into fuel for the ship.
- **Water Recycler:** A passive system that reduces the player's water consumption. Can be upgraded.
- **Life Support:** Sets the baseline `Comfort` and `Stress` levels on the ship. Can be upgraded for better passive recovery.

## Utility & Practice
- **Target Dummy:** A non-hostile dummy on the ship. When shot, it displays the exact damage dealt, allowing players to safely test their modified weapons and different ammo types.

## Expedition Interactables
- **Door:** Can be opened and closed.
- **Scavenged Item Node:** A generic loot source found in the world (e.g., server rack, alien plant) containing context-appropriate materials.
