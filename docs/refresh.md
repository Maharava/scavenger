# Scavenger - Vibe & Atmosphere

## What This Game Feels Like

This is a game about **silence and absence**. You are alone in a dead universe, picking through the bones of civilization. Every location you visit tells the story of people who tried to survive and failed. You're walking through their last moments, their abandoned hopes, their interrupted lives.

---

## The Core Experience

**Desolation.**

Not the dramatic, explosive end of the world. The quiet one. The one where systems failed, people left or died, and now there's just... nothing. Machines still running with no purpose. Lights still blinking for no one. Food rotting in kitchens where families once ate together.

You are a scavenger in the truest sense - you take what's left and try to survive another day. Every meal matters. Every bullet counts. Every piece of scrap metal could be the part that keeps your ship running.

---

## Tension Without Noise

Most rooms are empty. That's intentional. The fear isn't constant combat - it's **not knowing** if this room is empty. It's the silence before you open a door. It's the question: "Is something in there?"

When you do encounter enemies, it's rarely overwhelming. One creature. Maybe two. Enough to be dangerous. Enough to make you respect every engagement. You don't mow down hordes - you survive encounters.

The real threat is attrition. Hunger. Damaged body parts that won't fully heal without rest. Equipment wearing down. The slow grind of entropy.

## Environmental Storytelling

Every location whispers its history:

**The Habitat** - A place where children drew pictures on walls. Where families grew tomatoes in communal gardens. Where someone left a toy on the floor and never came back for it. Now the plants grow wild, choked with fungal growth, and something moves in the green darkness.

**The Listening Post** - Cold military precision. Duty rosters still on the wall. Bunks made with hospital corners. Someone's pinup poster fading in the corner. The servers still hum, listening to dead frequencies, waiting for orders that will never come. The security drones still patrol, protecting nothing.

**The Dyson Scaffold** - Scale beyond human comprehension. Catwalks suspended over voids. Machinery built to reshape stars. The sounds echo forever in these cathedral-sized manufacturing bays. You are an insect here. The defenses don't care - they'll crush you with the same indifference they showed their original builders.

## The Mundane Made Wrong

Horror isn't always tentacles and teeth. Sometimes it's:

- A mess hall with food still on trays
- A child's bedroom, bed neatly made, waiting
- A locker room with someone's clothes still hanging
- A security log that stops mid-sentence
- A message to loved ones that was never sent

The robots you encounter are not mindless drones. They possess a rudimentary, LLM-like sentience, capable of planning and even cooperation. However, their core programming forces them to react to the world, often trapping them in logic spirals, ceaselessly executing long-obsolete directives from a vanished civilization. Their hostility is not malice, but a tragic adherence to corrupted purpose.

Then you turn a corner and something that used to be human is shambling through the darkness, drawn by the sound of your footsteps. Or a security bot activates, still following protocols from decades ago, seeing you as an intruder.

---

## Types of Fear

**The Silent Fear** - Empty corridors. No sound but your breathing. The weight of abandonment.

**The Sudden Fear** - A door opens. Something's there. Now you fight or die.

**The Slow Fear** - Your hunger is at 20%. You have one ration left. The ship is three rooms away. You haven't found medical supplies. Your leg is at 60% efficiency. One more bad fight could cripple you.

**The Oppressive Fear** - You're in the depths of a massive structure. Lost in kilometers of corridors that all look the same. The map is unreliable. You're not sure which way is out. Your light is running low.

---

## Survival, Not Power Fantasy

You never become powerful. Better equipped, yes. More prepared, sure. But you're always fragile. Always mortal.

A security bot can still kill you in three shots even if you have armor. An aberrant can still maul you if you're careless. Running out of food in the middle of an expedition is still a death sentence.

Victory isn't domination. Victory is getting back to your ship alive with enough scrap to keep going another day.

---

## The Claustrophobic Universe

Everything is **tight**. Even large maps feel cramped because you're always in corridors, rooms, enclosed spaces. You're never in an open field. You're always inside metal boxes drifting in the void.

The universe isn't vast and full of adventure. It's a maze of coffins. Every station is a tomb. Every ship is a sarcophagus. You're crawling through the remains, hoping the next one has something worth taking.

---

## Choice and Consequence

Do you push deeper? Your hunger is getting dangerous but you haven't found much loot yet.

Do you fight? You could win, but you'll use ammunition and might take damage. Or you could try to sneak past.

Do you rest? You need to heal, but resting takes time, and time means hunger.

Do you explore that dark room? Could have supplies. Could have enemies. Could have nothing.

Every decision has weight because resources are finite and mistakes are punishing.

---

## The Atmosphere of Different Locations

**Easy Locations** - Civilian spaces. Homes. Gardens. The places people lived. Sadness more than horror. The mundane rendered eerie by absence. Scattered supplies, light resistance, but oppressively lonely.

**Medium Locations** - Military and technical. Automated systems still active. Not abandoned - defended. The machines don't know the war is over. Efficient. Cold. Hostile not through malice but through programming.

**Hard Locations** - Industrial megastructures. Inhuman scale. Built for purposes beyond survival. The security here was designed to protect trillion-dollar assets. You are nothing to these systems. The loot is incredible, if you can survive long enough to take it.

---

## The Tone

**Melancholic, not hopeless.** Yes, civilization fell. Yes, you're alone. But you're still here. Still trying. That counts for something.

**Tense, not frantic.** Danger is real but not constant. The tension is in the anticipation, not the action.

**Grounded, not fantastical.** This was a human universe once. Space stations, ships, mines, farms. Practical places for practical purposes. The horror comes from how they've been abandoned, corrupted, reclaimed by entropy and mutation.

**Small-scale, not epic.** You're not saving the galaxy. You're trying to eat tomorrow. That's the whole game. Survive. Scavenge. Repeat.

---

## What You Remember

After playing, the moments that stick aren't boss fights or explosions. They're:

- That empty residential block where every apartment looked the same, and you got turned around in the sameness
- Finding a community center with children's drawings still on the wall
- The long corridor where you heard something moving but never saw it
- Running out of ammunition and having to melee a security bot, knowing one mistake meant death
- Getting back to your ship with 5% hunger left and a damaged leg, having barely survived
- The mess hall where the tables were overturned, and you imagined what happened there
- Standing in an observation deck, looking at the stars, the only living thing in a tomb

---

## The Question the Game Asks

**"How long can you keep going?"**

Not forever. The universe is dead. You're just delaying the inevitable. But today? Today you can eat. Today you can sleep safely. Today you survived.

Tomorrow is another question.

---

## In Summary

Scavenger is lonely, tense, melancholic survival. It's about scraping by in a dead universe. It's about the weight of empty spaces and the stories they tell. It's about making hard choices with limited resources. It's about the fear of the unknown and the grind of entropy.

It's quiet horror and mundane tragedy. It's the end of the world, not with a bang, but with silence.

And somehow, despite everything, you're still here.
