# Crafting Materials Reference

**⚠️ STATUS: NOT IMPLEMENTED - This is a design document for a future crafting system**

**Current Implementation:** No crafting system exists. Players can swap modules at workbenches but cannot craft new items or modules. This table is for future development.

## Material Table

| Material Name | Rarity | Source | Primary Uses |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Salvaged Components** | Common | Deconstructing items, wall panels, scout drones | Basic ingredient for all low-tier modules and field repairs. |
| **Polymer Resin** | Common | Storage crates, interior fixtures, basic gear | Moldable plastic for basic grips, casings, and `Padded Underlays`. |
| **Aramid Fibres** | Uncommon | Crew quarters, cargo webbing, pirate armour | High-tensile fibres for `Ablative Overlays` and advanced `Padded Underlays`. |
| **Ceramic-Composite Plate** | Rare | Armoury lockers, Heavy Mechs, Enforcer armour | Dense, heat-treated plate for high-end `Ceramic` and `Composite` armour. |
| **Basic Electronics** | Common | Any electronic device, conduits, all robots | Wires, capacitors, and resistors for any module with an active component. |
| **Intact Logic Board** | Uncommon | Security bots, computer terminals, bridge consoles | Functional processor for "smart" modules (targeting aids, sensors). |
| **Focusing Lenses** | Rare | Sentry Turrets, lab equipment, navigation consoles | Pristine glass or crystal for optical modules (`Scopes`, `Laser Sights`). |
| **High-Capacity Battery** | Rare | Heavy Mechs, engine rooms, emergency power stations | Dense power source for energy weapons and high-drain armour mods. |
| **Chemical Compounds** | Uncommon | Medical bays, science labs, cleaning closets | Reactive chemicals for `Toxin` resistance, adhesives, or medical supplies. |
| **Thermal Gel** | Uncommon | Cryo-bays, heat exchangers | Core ingredient for all temperature-regulating `Underlays` (`Thermal`, `Mesh`). |
| **Energy-Reflective Film** | Rare | Science labs, sensor arrays, Sentry Turrets | Diffuses electromagnetic radiation. Core component for `Reflective Overlays`. |
| **Repair Paste** | Uncommon | Maintenance lockers, workshops, Scavengers | Epoxy-like substance to restore durability at a workbench. |
| **Xeno-Organic Slurry** | Uncommon | Any alien creature | Versatile biological base for nutrient packs, medical adhesives, or weak acids. |
| **Caustic Organ** | Rare | Alien 'Spitters' | The only source for crafting weapon mods that deal `Toxin` damage. |
| **Bio-Woven Chitin** | Rare | Alien 'Brutes' and 'Stalkers' | Superior alternative to Aramid Fibres for high-tier kinetic armour. |
| **Neuro-conductive Tissue** | Rare | Alien 'Stalkers' or 'Parasite Carriers' | Integrates with Logic Boards for advanced grips and accuracy mods. |
