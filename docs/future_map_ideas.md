## Biome-Specific Mechanics (Future Consideration)

### NATURE Biome Mechanics
**Overgrowth Blockages:**
- Some tiles blocked by vines/growth
- Requires cutting tool or fire weapon to clear
- Clearing creates noise (alert chance)
- Can hide loot or alternate paths

**Spore Clouds:**
- Certain NATURE rooms have toxic spore clouds
- Causes ongoing damage without protection
- Limits vision range
- Spore Walkers immune, other enemies affected

---

### TECH Biome Mechanics
**Hackable Terminals:**
- Active terminals can be hacked (if player has skill/item)
- Reveals portions of map
- Can disable security systems
- May trigger alarms if failed

**Surveillance System:**
- Some TECH rooms have active cameras
- Enemies alerted to player position
- Can be disabled at source
- Provides risk vs reward (disable for stealth, or rush through)

---

### SECURITY Biome Mechanics
**Trapped Corridors:**
- Pressure plates, tripwires, automated turrets
- Visible with high perception or detection tools
- Can be disarmed or bypassed
- Can be triggered to harm enemies

**Alarm Systems:**
- Certain actions trigger station-wide alarm
- Summons reinforcements from adjacent rooms
- Persists for X turns
- Can be disabled at security console

**Locked Armories:**
- High-value weapon/armor rooms
- Requires key card or hacking
- Guaranteed good loot
- Often heavily guarded

---

### TRANSIT Biome Mechanics
**Airlock Venting:**
- Player can trigger emergency airlocks
- Vents enemies into space (instant kill)
- Costs oxygen/ship resources
- Room becomes inaccessible (void)
- Risk vs reward decision

**Docking Bay Control:**
- Can seal/open bay doors
- Create chokepoints or escape routes
- Some enemies can't operate doors (aliens)
- Robots can override (time delay)

---

### INDUSTRIAL Biome Mechanics
**Active Machinery:**
- Some equipment still running
- Conveyor belts, assembly arms, forges
- Can be used against enemies (push into hazards)
- May block optimal paths
- Can be shut down (sometimes)

**Resource Extraction:**
- Special nodes for gathering rare materials
- Requires time (vulnerable during extraction)
- Makes noise (enemy attraction)
- Higher yield than normal loot

---

### RESIDENTIAL Biome Mechanics
**Searchable Containers:**
- Lockers, safes, storage units
- May require lockpicking or codes
- Random quality (usually low-mid tier)
- Rare chance for personal valuables

**Rest Spots:**
- Beds, couches, safe rooms
- Can rest to recover (if clear of enemies)
- Risky (can be ambushed)
- Time cost

---

## Procedural "Story Moments" Concept

Brief environmental storytelling based on biome combinations and map generation.

**Examples:**

- **NATURE + TECH:** Find research logs about bio-experiment containment failure
- **INDUSTRIAL + SECURITY:** Evidence of worker uprising, robot suppression
- **RESIDENTIAL + ATMOSPHERIC:** Evacuation records, incomplete escape attempts
- **NATURE + RESIDENTIAL:** Family gardens, children's plant projects, normalcy twisted
- **TECH + SECURITY:** Classified files, intelligence gathering, paranoia
- **INDUSTRIAL + TRANSIT:** Shipping manifests, cargo discrepancies, smuggling

**Implementation Notes:**
- Would require 20-30 unique story snippets per biome combination
- Text logs, environmental details, interactable terminals
- Optional flavor, doesn't affect gameplay
- Risk of repetition if not enough variety

---

## Notes on Future Expansion

- These locations can be added incrementally after core three are stable
- Each location template should be data-driven and easily moddable
- Biome-specific mechanics add complexity - only add when base systems solid
- Story moments are optional flavor - nice-to-have, not essential
- Focus should always be on tight, atmospheric exploration with meaningful choices
